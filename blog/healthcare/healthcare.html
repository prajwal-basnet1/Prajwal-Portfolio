                <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
                    <p> After working in residential aged care, my curious mind began exploring big ideas of system. For an outsider with no clinical degree, i was not fortunate with head start; As a result my relentless pursuit for uncovering know-how started. </p> 
                    <p>Following the directive of great algebrist, Jacobi, to “Invert always invert”; That most hard problems are not solved by thinking forward, rather by thinking backwards; Similarly, i started by the pursuit of recognizing simplicity –that is, to form bedrock ideas, rather than deconstructing intricate complexity –to learn thousand of technical nuance. As a result, this endeavor aims to: unviel the complexity, serves as vague guide in documentation without compromising core ideas, and -most importantly, interconnectedness of ideas from various discipline.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2 id="Checklist">1. Checklist</h3>
                    <p>The surest means to avoid failure and to decrease complexity is through the use of checklist. In aviation industry, checklist has been used successfully from very early in almost every pilot endeavor resulting in one of the safest means of transportation. Pilots are trained to trust their (checklist) more than their instinct.</p>
                    
                <p><em><code class="sidekick">&quot;No pilots every fly without checklist&quot;</code></em></p>
                <p>Similarly, medical professionals have to go through intense pressure. They have to get the knowledge right and then make sure 100 daily task that follow are done correctly -despite monitor sign going off, despite patient in bed crashing, and despite nurse poking head around curtain. </p>
                <p>After learning from aviation industry, WHO began creating their own checklist which after implementation resulted in major complication decrease by 36 percent and deaths fell by 47 percent. Also, 78 percent observed checklist to have prevented an error in operating room. Now the whole health sector has evolved with the use of checklist, knowing or unknowing. Checklist are different for different operation and circumstance. </p>
                <p>In residential aged care, the whole system, more or less, are implemented based on checklist to monitor changes of hundreds of consumer with the use of charts and notes. Each consumer are assigned specific chart to track key areas such as behaviour, mobility, sleep, pain, bowel etc. Then, the charts and notes serves as component of checklist that needs to be completed individually. 
</p>
                                
                <h2 id="Individuals liberty">2. Individual liberty <i>[Person Center Care]</i></h2>
                <p>Individual liberty is the right to believe, act, and express oneself freely. It is right of every men as far as it does not hurt or control the rights of another which is the only check it ought to suffer.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, Person center care is a care philosophy that puts individual liberty into practice by ensuring that care is tailored to support individual autonomy and dignity. </p>


                <p><em><code class="sidekick">&quot;As having their own way is the greatest comfort of life to aged people. I think their friends should endeavor them in that, as well in anything else, when they lived long enough; They are almost as closely connected with it as tortoise with its shell; old folks and old trees, if you remove them it is ten to one that you will kill them&quot;</code></em>~ Benjamin Franklin</p>
               <p>However, In practice especially with cognitively impaired person putting this into practice is not always straight forward. For carer and nurse, this can be slippery slope. As they have a duty to care (not to neglect), as well as supporting individual liberty. Therefore, one should be prepared for “careful yes” or “respectful no” by providing careful explanation, alternatives, in conjunction with statute and policy.</p> 

                <h2 id="Four pillars of aged people">3. Four Dimension of Care - Physical, Behavior, Cognition, and Mental Health</h2>
                <p>There are lot of tool that clinical experts assess to determine state of consumer health and well being. By large sense, these tools, more or less, are centered around four pillars: Physical, behaviour, cognition, and mental health. 
</p> 
                <p>However, For an outsider, like myself, it is challenging to determine declining state of consumer health, creating inconsistency in actual reporting system and state of consumer. Therefore,I wrestled with whether to make this content concise or thorough, and decided to strike a balance - highlighting key concepts in a list with examples, to aid outsiders."

                <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
                    <p>
For an outsider without clinical background, understanding and navigating these system may initially seem daunting. To overcome this challenge, my journey underscores habitual use of checklist, ability to assess unique declining state of consumer and principles of person center care.
