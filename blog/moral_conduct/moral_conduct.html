                <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

                <p>I am fascinated by Benjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln. I am persuaded that it requires great study for any man who brings great changes and accomplishes great affairs without forfeiture of honesty.
</p>
                <p>I have read extensively about them, and following their conduct as a fair way of improvement, I have decided to structure my moral conduct to guard against vices– to keep the wolf out from entering, than to labour at pulling its teeth once he is within; And, at length, to form scheme of action that, henceforth, help me live as a rational and moral creature.</p>

                <p>This endeavour consists of: <a href="#Code_of_conduct">code of conduct</a>,<a href="#virtue"> desired virtues</a>, <a href="#prayer"> Prayer</a>,<a href="#poems"> poems</a>,<a href="#pain_pleasure"> pain and pleasure</a>,<a href="#employer_employee"> employer and employee relation</a>,<a href="#junto"> junto</a>,<a href="#Piece of writings"> piece of writings</a>,<a href="#education"> education</a>, <a href="#wits and wisdom"> wits and wisdoms</a>, and, by and large, autobiography of ben franklin (and moral conduct itself).</a>

                <h2 id="Code_of_conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

                <p>One man of tolerable abilities may work great changes and accomplish great affairs among mankind, if he first forms a good plan and makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and business.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>It is necessary for me to be extremely frugal for sometime, till I have paid what I owe.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>To endeavour to speak truth in every instance, to give nobody expectations that are not likely to be answered; but aim at sincerity in every word and action: the most amiable excellence in rational being.
</li><br>
                    <li>To apply myself industriously to whatever business I take in hand,
And not divert my mind from my business by any foolish project of growing suddenly rich: for industry and patience is the surest means of plenty.</li><br>
                    <li>I resolve to speak ill of no man, whatever, not even in matter of truth, 
But rather by some means excuse the faults I hear charged upon others;
And upon proper occasion speak all the good i know of everybody. </li>
                </ol>

                <h2 id="virtue">Virtue</h2>
                <ol>
                        <li>Temperance: Eat not to dullness, drink not to elevation.</li><br>

<li>Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourselves; avoid trifling conversation.</li><br>

<li>Order: Let all your things have their places. Let each part of your business have time.</li><br>

<li>Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought; Perform without fail what you resolve. </li><br>

<li>Frugality: Make no expense but to do good to others or yourselves.</li><br>

<li>Industry: Loose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut all unnecessary actions.</li><br>

<li>Sincerity: Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and if you speak, speak accordingly. </li><br>

<li>Justice: Wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your duty.</li><br>

<li>Moderation: Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries, as much as you think they deserve. </li><br>

<li>Cleanliness: Tolerate no uncleanness in body, clothes or habitation. </li><br>

<li>Tranquility: Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.</li><br>

<li>Chastity: Never use venery but for health, offspring; Never to dullness, weakness, or injury of our own or another pace of reputation.</li><br>

<li>Humility: Imitate Jesus or Socrates. </li><br>
</li>                    
                </ol>

                <h2 id="prayer">Prayer</h2>
                <ol>

And in my address to you carefully avoid irreverence and ostentation, 
Formality and odious hypocrisy. </li><br>

<li>That i may be loyal to my prince and faithful to my country, 
Careful for its good, valiant in its defence, and obedient to its laws,
Abhorring treason as much as tyranny.</li><br>

<li>That i may be those above me be dutiful, humble and submissive;
Avoiding pride, disrespect and contumacy.</li><br>

Insolence and unreasonable severity.</li><br>

<li>That i may be refrain from censure, calumny, and detraction; 
That i may avoid and abhor deceit and envy, fraud, flattery and hatred, 
Malice and ingratitude. </li><br>

<li>That I may be sincere in friendship, faithful in trust, and impartial in judgement,
Watchful against pride and against anger (that monetary madness).
</li><br>

<li>That i may be just in my dealings, temperate in my pleasures, 
Full of candour and ingenuity, humanity and benevolence. </li><br>

<li>That I may be grateful to my benefactor, generous to my friends, 
Exercising charity and liberty to the poor and pity to the miserable. </li><br>

<li>That i may avoid avarice and ambition, 
Jealousy and intemperance, falsehood, luxury and lasciviousness. </li><br>

<li>That i may possess integrity and evenness of mind, resolution in difficulties, 
Fortitude under affliction; that i may be punctual in performing my promise, peaceable and prudent in my behaviour.
</li><br>

<li>That i may be tenderness for the weak and reverent respect for ancient;
That I may be kind to my neighbour, good natured to my companion, and hospitable to strangers.
</li><br>

<li>That i may be averse from table bearing, backbitting, detraction, slander and craft and overreaching, abhor extortion, perjury and every kind of wickedness.</li><br>

<li>That i may be honest and open hearted, gentle, merciful, good, 
And cheerful in spirit, rejoicing in the good of others. 
</li><br>

<li>That i may have constant regard of honour and probity,
 that i may possess perfect innocence and good conscience,
and, at length, become truly virtuous and magnanimous. 
</li><br>

		<h2 id="pain_pleasure">Pain and pleasure</h2>
    <p>Men are not machine driven by necessity rather, in practice, there are things such as right or wrong.</p>

<p>Whatever is created must, in its own nature, be subject to error, irregularity, excess, and disorder</p>

<p>We are obliged by reason to take as much care for our future as our present happiness, and not to build one upon the ruins of other; So this philosophy of self denial is only refusing to do action which you strongly desire because it is inconsistent with your fortune, health or circumstance in the world. In other words, it would cost you more than its worth.</p>

<p>Good of man is not natural and sensual, but rational and moral.</p>

<p>A man is perfect when he fulfill highest potential of nature -with reason, virtue, discipline and contribution to others.</p>

<p> zest for reason, hunger for goodness, a passion for wisdom.</p>

<p> Aim to resolve the conflict of instinct toward pleasure and faith in reasonable virtue.</p>

<p> or sensual pleasure continues no more than action itself, but this divine or moral pleasure [ doing good to others ] continues when the action is over; And swells and grows upon hands by reflection.</p>

<p>Natural or sensual pleasure is inconstant, unsatisfying, of short duration and attended with numberless ill; the other is constant yield full of satisfaction, is durable, and no evils preceding or following it.</p>

<p>Upon further inquiry into why moral pleasures are greater than sensual; 
Perhaps the reason is their happiness or chief good is acting to their chief faculty,
Or that faculty which distinguishes them all creatures of different species.
</p>

            <p>Natural good and ill is pleasure and pain;
While moral good and ill is pleasure and pain with intention and design.
            </p>

            <p>Goodness without wisdom can be harmful.
Wisdom without goodness can be dangerous.
Thus, true virtue requires both.</p>

<p>Self denial is never a duty, or reasonable action;
But it is a natural means of procuring more pleasure than you can taste without it.</p>

<p>All intelligent rational agent find in themselves a power of judging what kind of being they are; What action are proper to preserve’em and what consequence will generally attend them, what pleasure they are formed for, and to what degree their nature are capable of receiving them. </p>

<p>While my care was employed in guarding against one fault, 
I was often surprised by another;
Habit took advantage of inattention.
</p>

<p>Inclination is too strong for reason, 
Thus just attention to be virtuous is not enough, 
We ought to form uniform steady rectitude of conduct first.
</p>

<p>Contrary habits must be broken,
And good ones acquired and established, 
Before we can have dependence on steady, uniform rectitude of conduct.</p>

            <p>
Right action cannot be produce without right opinion.
Thus, foundation of all virtue is thinking rightly.
            </p>

            <p>
Those who write of the art of poetry teaches up that if we would write what may be worth reading we ought always, before we begin, to form regular plan and design of our piece.

A hearty lover of clergy and all good man, 
And mortal enemy to arbitrary government and unlimited power. 
</p>
<p>
I have likewise a natural inclination to observe and reprove the faults of others. 
I now take up a resolution to do for the future all that lies in my way for the service of my countrymen.
</p>    
<p>
Without freedom of thoughts there can be no such thing as wisdom;
And no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech;
Which is the right of every man as far as it does not hurt or control the right of another.
This is the only check it ought to suffer and only bounds it ought to know.
</p>
<p>
Hypocritical pretenders to religion are worse for common wealth than openly profane
</p>
<p>
You are young and you have world before you;
Stop as you go through it, 
And you will miss many hard bumps.
</p>
<p>
Franklin was not too young to reflect on the dangers of carrying a head too high.
</p>
<p>
He wished to please everybody; 
And having little to give, he gave expectation.
</p>
<p>
Since god was all-wise, all-good, all-powerful, 
And yet permitted the world to be what it was; 
Therefore, there could be no such things as natural virtues and vices. 
Men had no freewill, did what they must and could not be blamed or praised for their behavior. 
</p>

<p>
What moved them to action was their desire to avoid pain and experience pleasure. 
</p>
<p>
The monarch was not happier than slaves, nor the beggar more miserable than Croesus.
</p>
<p>
The young realist was a moralist.
In short, I believe it is impossible for man, though he has all the cunnings of devil,
To live and die a villain, and yet conceal it so well to carry the name of an honest fellow
To his grave with him, but someone by some accident shall discover him.
</p>
<p>
Truth and sincerity have certain distinguishing native lustre about them which cannot be perfectly counterfeited; they are like fire and flame, that can not be painted.
</p>
<p>
Truly wise people are never lonely when they are by themselves. 
I acknowledge solitude an agreeable refreshment to busy mind; 
But were these thinking people obliged to be always alone, 
I am apt to think they would quickly find their very best being insupportable to them.
</p>
<p>
I would rather be a very stupid block in nature than a possessor of all knowledge without some intelligent being to communicate. 
</p>
<p>
Let the ladies make one long sea voyage with them, 
And if they have the least spark of ill nature in them,
And conceal it to end of voyage,
I will forfeit my pretension to their favour.
</p>
<p>
A single man resembles an odd half of a pair of scissors.
A single man has not nearly the value he would have in state of union.
</p>
<p>
When man differ in opinion, both sides ought equally to have the advantage of being heard by public;
And that when truth and error have fairplay,
Former always matches latter.
</p>
<p>
I took care not only to be in reality: industrious and frugality.
But to avoid all appearances to the contrary. 
I dressed plainly; I was seen at no places of idle diversion. 
I never went to fishing or shooting; a book, indeed sometimes debauched me from my work,
But that was seldom snug and gave no scandal.
</p>
<p>
And to show that i was not above my business, 
I sometimes brought home the paper I purchased through streets on wheel barrows.
</p>
<p>
A large part of his leisure time had always been devoted to the concern of common life: warming houses with a stove, protecting them against fire etc. 
</p>
<p>
Never be discouraged by any apprehension that arts come to such perfection in England as to be incapable of further improvement. As yet, the quantity of human knowledge bears no proportion to the quantity of human ignorance. 
</p>
<p>
A wise man that often acts foolishly, a wit that seldom acted wisely. 
If enough were the mans to make mans happy, 
One always had the means of happiness without ever enjoying the thing. 
The other always had a thing without possessing means. 
One even in prosperity always fretting; 
Others in the midst of poverty are always laughing. 
</p>
<p>
When I considered the character of good wives was far preferable to that of being only a pretty woman.
</p>
<p>
When the brightest of female virtues shine among other perfection of body and mind in the same person, it makes a woman more lovely than an angel.
</p>
<p>
In business, Franklin was extremely alert to the main chance;
adaptable, crafty though not petty, and ruthless on occasion.
</p>
<p>
Happiness in life is rather depended on internal than external; 
and that, beside the natural effect of wisdom and virtue, vice and folly, 
There is no such thing as a happy or unhappy constitution. 
</p>
<p>
The seed of the english was already planted in america, 
And would grow itself without further immigration. 
You now fear our virtuous young king will be overwhelmed by political groups forming against him, 
And that his time as king will be difficult or troubled. 
But I believe the opposite, his strong character,
and genuine desire to do good to his people,
will give him the courage and stability he needs. 
</p>
<p>
The honest advisor he chosen him will support him and once people see that he’s firm 
 And principled political opposition will fade away like fog disappearing in the morning sun.
</p>
<p>
Our opinion or inclination would weight little among you.
We are in your hands as clay in hands of potter;
For as potter cannot waste or spoil his clay without injuring himself, 
So i think there is scarce in anything you can do that may be hurtful to us,
But what will be as much or more so to you.
Therefore, for interest with you we have but little. 
The cat can yield but her skin. 
</p>
<p>
Englishman are too apt to silent when they have nothing to say;
Too sullen when they are silent;
And when sullen - depressed. 
</p>
<p>
Trade is voluntary things between buyer and seller, 
In every article of which each exercises his own judgement and is to please himself. 
</p>
<p>
Debts of honor are generally paid as any other payment. 
Where no compulsion can be used, it is more disgraceful to be dishonest. 
</p>
<p>
Their necessity makes them rapacious, their office make them proud and insolent. 
Their insolence and rapacity makes them odious, and being conscious that they are hatted, 
They become malicious; their malice urges them to continually abuse the inhabitants. 
</p>
<p>
Franklin was economical of time and words; but the sage was not too grave to play jokes on his friends. 
</p>
<p>
I think happiness consists more in small conveniences or pleasures that occur everyday than in great pieces of good fortune that happen but seldom to a man in the course of his life. 
</p>
<p>
Christian doctrines of forgiveness of injuries and doing good to enemies. 
</p>
<p>
By premature struggle we may be crippled and keep down another age;
That as between friends every affront is not worth a duel, 
between nation every injury not worth a war, 
So between governed and government every mistake,
Every mistake on government, every encroachment of right, 
Not worth a deal. 
</p>
<p>
Franklin letter to americans were so moderate and pacific that radical suspected him, 
Too much English”.
</p>
<p>
In emergency men behave, not according to what they later reflected would have been wise, but according to their characters at the time. 
</p>
<p>
Franklin already had instinct to be patient under stress, 
Habit of magnanimity and schooled knowledge of world which made him realise that the longer the enemy wants the sooner his words will be held against him.
</p>
<p>
Grievance cannot be redressed unless they are known. And they cannot be known but through complaints and petition. 
</p>
<p>
Angry nation, like angry man, accuse each other of having first offended, 
And excuse themselves by claiming that they have acted merely in self defense. 
</p>
<p>
Great empire have crumbled because they were too remote to be understood by the central government. 
</p>
<p>
In his own mind, he had gone through issue discussed before and had to watch younger men learn what he already know.
</p>
<p>
Slaves rather weaken than strengthen the state, 
And therefore there is some difference between them and sheep;
Sheep will never make any insurrections. 
</p>
<p>
His plans and his examples were to abolish monarchy, aristocracy and hierarchy. 
</p>
<p>
He loves his ease, hates to offend and seldom gives any opinion till obliged to do it. 
Although he has determined a soul as any man, yet in his constant policy 
Never to say yes or no decidedly but when he cannot avoid it. 
</p>
<p>
Franklin made a rule, “always to support one’s friend may be right till one finds them wrong, 
Rather than to suppose them wrong till one finds them right”.
</p>
<p>
It is enough for a good mind to be affected by other people's misfortune; but they, that are vexed at everybody's good luck, can never be happy.
</p>
<p>
Since the foolish part of mankind will make wars from time to time with each other, not having sense enough otherwise to settle their difference; 
It certainly becomes wiser part, 
Who cannot prevent those wards, to alleviate as much possible,
The calamities attending them.
</p>
<p>
The war in America is for the future to be only defensive. I hope we should be too prudent to have too much dependence on formal declaration ( we still have to act wise).
</p>
<p>
A nation's attitude can change quickly even if they seem humble.
With a bit of success could make them arrogant again. 
I remember when i was boxing boy even after my opponent said he had enough,
It was still allowed to give him one last punch as he was getting up - let's make sure our last punch is a strong one. 
</p>

<p>
Franklin was good natured, simple, gentle,
With serenity that passed into gaiety. 
He rarely spoke at length  and for the most part in the form of a story which he told to make points. 
</p>
<p>
When he talked it was without gestures or movements of his head or body. 
</p>
<p>
O that moral science was in a fair way of improvement that men would cease to be wolf to one another, and that human beings at length learn what they now improperly called humanity. 
</p>
<p>
To make lasting peace, the method is very simple, which was to settle terms in the first projection on equal, just and reasonable footings. 
</p>
<p>
If war was to continue to the satisfaction of both America and France, it was to the interest of both to share equal cost.  
</p>
<p>
States which leaves all her ports open to all the world upon equal terms will by that means have foreign commodities cheaper, sell its own production dearer and on the whole prosper. 
</p>
<p>
Better for America to lose the benefits of the empire, than to be at the mercy of quarreling English politicians. 
</p>
<p>
If he does not bring fortune with him, he must work and be industrious to live. In short, America is the land of labour. 
</p>
<p>
I am determined to give him trade so that he may have something to depend on and not be obliged to ask favour or office of anybody.
</p>
<p>
In free government, rulers are servants and people their superiors and sovereigns . for the former to return among later was not to degrade but to promote. 
</p>
<p>
The accumulation of property and its security to individuals in every society must be affected by protection afforded it by joint strength in society in execution of its law. 
</p>
<p>
Agriculture recourse should not be wasted, and that farming must be something of business as science as way of life.
</p>
<p>
Let there be as few as possible artificial bonds which make unnatural wars.
</p>
<p>
If we do foolish things we are the first to laugh at ourselves.
</p>
<p>
Let commerce and knowledge bind the continent together. 	
</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>
Prose writing has been of great use to me in the course of life,
And was the principal means of advancement.
</p>
<p>
Determined to endeavour to improve is a moral duty.
</p>
<p>
Making short hits of sentiments at each sentence, 
Laid them by a few days, and then without looking at book;
I tried to complete the papers again. 
After comparing, I wanted a stock of words, or readiness in recollecting and using them.
</p>
<p>
Since the continual occasion for words of the same import, 
but of different length to suit the measure, 
or of different sound for the rhyme,
Would have laid me under constant necessity of searching for variety;
And also have a tendency to fix that variety in my mind and master it.
</p>
<p>
For study, Franklin needed both time and money; 
Which he exercised by reading at night,
Or evading as much as he could during common attendance. 
</p>
<p>
Riches and poverty kept the gate, 
And poverty rejected those whom riches did not recommend. 
Within temple of learning, most of worshipper withdrew their hands from plow, 
And contented themselves to sit at the food with madam idleness, and her maid ignorance.
Until those who had ascended by diligence and temper, 
when they were to inquire the assistance,
Who had got up before them and, who, for pint of milk, 
Or piece of plum cake, lend their lubbers a helping; 
And sat them in the eyes of the world to level themselves.  
</p>
<p>
Every beetle skull seemed well satisfied with his own portion of learning, 
Though perhaps he was just as ignorant as ever. 
Once out of temple, “some perceived to took to merchandising, others to travelling”, 
And some to nothing; and many of them from henceforth for want of patrimony, 
Lived as poor as church mice, being unable to dig, 
And ashamed to beg, and to live by their wits it was impossible. 
</p>
<p>
Students should diet together plainly, temperately and frugally. 
And frequently exercise in running, leaping, wrestling and swimming. 
</p>
<p>
As to their study, it would be good if they could be taught everything that is useful and ornamental.
But art is long and time is short. 
It is therefore they learn those things that are likely to be most useful, regard being had to be several professions for which they are intended. 
</p>
<p>
All should be taught to write with a fair hand and swift as that is useful to all. 
</p>
<p>
Reading should also be taught and pronouncing properly, distinctly, emphatically; not with even tone which underdoes, nor a theatrical, which overdoes nature. 
</p> 
<p>
Franklin urged students to read histories of nature and commerce, 
Of invention, arts, rise of manufactures, progress of trade, change of its seats, 
With reason, causes etc.
</p>
<p>
This would lead to curiosity of mechanics, 
“Art by which weak men perform such wanders, 
Labour is saved and manufacture expedited”
</p>
<p>
Finally, with whole should they be constantly inoculated and cultivated,
That benignity of mind which show itself in search for seizing every opportunity to serve and oblige is the foundation of what is called good breading. 
</p>
<p>
For reasonable, sensible men can always make a reasonable scheme 
Appear to other reasonable men, if they take pains and have time and opportunity for it. 
Unless from circumstance, their honesty and good intention are suspected. 
</p>
<p>
Effective humor in both writing and speech he was later to believe, 
Had the virtue of cathartic, 
An antidote to weighty would not be an escape but a restorative. 
</p>
<p>
Keep up your spirit and that will keep up your body.
</p>
<p>
Humans are limited in understanding, 
And shaped by outside influence.
So its arrogant to think you are completely right
And others are completely wrong. 
Instead of judging belief by who holds them,
We should look at their effects; 
If they make people better, 
not worse then those belief are not harmful.
